        <p>Super Smash Bros Ultimate tournament happening next week on the 8th at 6pm! (back from 7pm) We will be having 2 tournaments, a 2v2 tournament starting at 6:30 and a 1v1 tournament starting when the 2v2 wraps up, both with prizes! We will be having pizza and free drinks (cuz the soda machine :p). If smash is not your game we will have board games and others games. Feel free to invite non devmountaineers friends/family to join, but remember the door will lock so you will need to let them in. Also please fill out the survey below if you intend to come we can get a head count.</p>
